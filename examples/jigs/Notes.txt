1178 doesn't work


3. No zoom fit shortcut

Notes:
  i) Label IN an OUT
 ii) Rload instead of current sources

1013: A LT1004 model would be nice
1013D: convergense issue without gmin=1e-10
1017: delay on power up circuit error
1043 model is for shit
1112/1114 model woundn't do fig 1 on datasheet: rail error!
1113 10Hz Fourth Order Chebyshev Lowpass Filter had 37mdB ripple, not .01dB

1182 LCD VC doesn't start at zero.

Need a model of the 1N5712 for the 1195
550mV @ 1mA

.model 5082-2800 D(BV=75 Cjo=1.6p EG=0.69 IBV=10E-5 IS=2.2E-9 N=1.08 RS=25 PB=.6 XTI=2 M=.5)

1208 has too much bias current

1213/1214 3Pole Butterworth filters have 1.2 dB peaking

PSspice solves the 1219 when shutdown pin is strobed better than LTspice

1246 model err amp doesn't start at 0
1265 models have poor latency
1266 reverses current when bursting and it looks like hell
1268/B SUPPLIES NO SW DAMPING
1328 model blows
1336 model does switch with startup option

1440/1540 Alternate solver required

1494/1495/1496 datasheet 6th filter has schematic errors
1504 has defcons
1636 model broken
1700 model cross conducts

1711/1713 datasheet: Fig 7 has the filter connected to the wrong output

1784 Single Supply Full Wave Rectifier circuit doesn't work

1792 has more than .01dB ripple
1795 punted

1803/1804/1805 circuit doesn't work very well UNLESS R4 is 10K instead of 1K

1807 shows 1.5dB peaking, not .75dB peaking like in datasheet
1809 model blows
1880 datasheet fig 2: extreme case is BS
1922-1full.asc needs work
3215 has defcon issues


datasheet errors:
1113 10Hz Fourth Order Chebyshev Lowpass Filter had 37mdB ripple, not .01dB
1880 datasheet fig 2: extreme case is BS
